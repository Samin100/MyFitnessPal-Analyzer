# MyFitnessPal-Analyzer
Tools for analyzing MyFitnessPal data through coddingtonbear's unofficial MFP API

# Introduction
This is the start of a simple web application that imports a user's MyFitnessPal data and provides insights such as:
  -calorie averages (weekly/monthy/custom period)
  -most common meals
  -highest/lowest calorie days
  -macronutrient ratios
  -nutritional analysis (actual vs. ideal nutrition)
# Tools that will be helpful
Backend will be written in Python and use coddingtonbear's API found at https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal.
In addition, charting libraries will be required to plot the nutrition data.
