# MyFitnessPal-Analyzer
Tools for analyzing MyFitnessPal data through coddingtonbear's unofficial MFP API

# Introduction
This is the start of a simple web application that imports a user's MyFitnessPal data and provides insights such as:
<ol>
  <li>calorie averages (weekly/monthy/custom period)</li>
  <li>most common meals</li>
  <li>highest/lowest calorie days</li>
  <li>macronutrient ratios</li>
  <li>nutritional analysis (actual vs. ideal nutrition) -> open to interpretation</li>
</ol>

# Tools that will be helpful
Backend will be written in Python and use coddingtonbear's API found at https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal.
In addition, charting libraries will be required to plot the nutrition data.
