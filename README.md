# Introduction
Tools for analyzing and providing insights on a user's MyFitnessPal data through coddingtonbear's unofficial MFP API. Once the backend has been fleshed out I will develop it into a web application for others to use.

# Frameworks, APIs, and tools
<ol>
  <li>The backend will be written in Python and use coddingtonbear's API found at https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal.</li>
  <li>In addition, charting libraries will be required to plot the nutrition data. For the web app portion, maybe Flask or Django. I'm learning towards Django since we'll require user authentication for their MFP account.</li>
</ol>

# TODO
This application is in the planning stage. The data we have is essentially what someone eats, it's nutritional values, and that person's nutritional goals. With this we can display interesting statistics regarding a person's eating habits (ideal vs realistic, etc).

Here's a list of features to be implemented:

<ol>
  <li>calorie averages (weekly/monthly/custom period)</li>
  <li>most common food/meal</li>
  <li>highest/lowest calorie days</li>
  <li>macronutrient ratios</li>
  <li>caloric/macro consumption plots
  <li> general nutritional analysis -> open to interpretation</li>
</ol>
Feel free to recommend any tools or insights that should be added.
